# Satellite image segmentation and classification
Using tiled data from Mapbox satellite and OpenStreetMap. OSM vector data provides "labels" on which to train the image processing algorithms.

Dataset generation via ![skynet-data](https://github.com/developmentseed/skynet-data). Inspiration from https://www.machinalis.com/blog/obia/.
